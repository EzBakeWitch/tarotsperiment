the Rider-Waite-Smith deck was drawn by [Pamela Coleman
Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_Colman_Smith). this is the original
version, free of US Games's revisions. the interpretations are by [Mark
McElroy](http://www.madebymark.com/2014/07/06/my-latest-book-belongs-to-you/).
both the art and the interpretations are public domain (the former by age, the
latter by the author's graces).

the Silicon Dawn deck is by [Egypt Urnash](http://egypt.urnash.com/tarot/), and
is used here with her explicit permission. it's a good deck (especially if
you're queer, furry, transhuman, or a queer furry transhuman), though sadly out
of print at the moment (mid-september 2018). the interpretations are also used
with her permission, as Silicon Dawn deviates significantly from
Rider-Waite-Smith interpretations.

the Neon Moon deck is by [Pixel Occult](http://www.neonmoontarot.com/), and is
also used with explicit permission. the colors work *really* well with the
asciifier, and i'm happy that the creator was cool enough to let me use them :)

the asciifying process is done using [a program i wrote
myself](https://github.com/deifactor/ascender). it's done entirely
automatically; i'm sure that you could hand-tune the characters to produce
vastly more intelligible output.

[the code itself](https://github.com/deifactor/lost-purpose) is all me (Ash),
but relies on more libraries than i can count.
